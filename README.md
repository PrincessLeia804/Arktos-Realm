- Upon starting a new game a pop-up will explain how to move across the ice and inform the player of the time limit, the help-, and give-up-buttons 
- The way through the hexagon-shaped maze will first light up step by step and stay visible for 2 seconds before disappearing
- The player then clicks its way through step by step through the maze
- If the player choses the correct step, the ice floe will light up and the character moves to the new position
- If the player choses a wrong step, the try ends and a life will be taken. If a life remains, the player may try again.
- A timer will limit the time to solve to 30 seconds starting after the route preview
- The help button will reveal 2x per round the next step
- The give up button will finish the game
