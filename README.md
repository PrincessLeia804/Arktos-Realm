### Description
Arktos keeps hold of the Infinity Stones. Help Tabaluga to catch Arktos and retrieve the stones, before he will do unspeakable things.

Be careful!<br>
The ice is very thin and will break if you take a wrong step.


### MVP
- Players can chose the difficulty level before starting the game
- Hovering over the difficulty button will show details on the differences
- Upon starting a new game a pop-up will explain how to move across the ice and inform the player of the time limit, the help-, give-up- and surprise-buttons 
- The way through the hexagon-shaped maze will first light up step by step and stay visible for 2 seconds before disappearing
- The player then klicks its way through step by step through the maze
- If the player choses the correct step, the ice floe will light up and the character moves to the new position
- If the player choses a wrong step, the try ends and a life will be taken. If a life remains, the player may try again.
- A timer will limit the time to solve to 60 seconds
- The help button will reveal once the next step
- The give up button will finish the game
- The surprise button holds, well... a surprise
